It seems so wrong
That day you walked out it wasn't your turn
I feel the blame
I hold onto, But it does not feel the same
It has been to long
I wish I could call you
But there isn't a number for where you've gone now

Heaven is a place where we all go to
When we're tired of sticking around
And I better see you when I get there
You know I'm not messing around
You better have a spot saved at that table
Cause I can't stand waiting around
When the angels sing
They sing la la la la la la la la la ...Till we meet again
Till we meet again... you know until we meet again

That day you left town
It's been so quiet, With out your voice to even make a sound
It seems so wrong
That day you walked out it wasn't your turn
The seasons change
Let me know, if I can do anything to get it re-arranged

Heaven is a place where we all go to
When we're tired of sticking around
And I better see you when I get there
You know I'm not messing around
You better have a spot saved at that table
Cause I can't stand waiting around
When the angels sing
They sing la la la la la la la la la

Heaven is a place where we all go to
When we're tired of sticking around
And I better see you when I get there
You know I'm not messing around
You better have a spot saved at that table
Cause I can't stand waiting around
When the angels sing
They sing la la la la la la la la la
Till we meet again
Till we meet again
Till we meet again
Till we meet again... you know until we meet again
