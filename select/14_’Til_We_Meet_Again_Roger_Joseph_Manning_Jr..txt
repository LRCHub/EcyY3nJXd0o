Slow down there's no hurry
Have no fear and don't you worry
Sleep tight 'til the morning
Or 'til we meet again

Alright, stop your cryin'
Dont be scared and don't be frightened
Just hold tight 'til the morning
Or 'til we meet again

Desperate to do what's right
Sacrifice all your life
Give 'til it hurts and I will return
You won't be alone tonight

Now cheer up it's far from over
You've reached the end but you're starting over
Free fall and sweet surrender
'Til we meet again

That voice inside your head (that voice inside your head)
Your closest life long friend (your closest life long friend)
A wink of an eye and soon you'll know why
Your story never ends

So let go, you'll feel much better
This whole world thinks it's so damn clever
But nobody knows and that's forever
Or 'til we meet again (we meet again)

'Til we meet again (we meet again)
'Til we meet again l
