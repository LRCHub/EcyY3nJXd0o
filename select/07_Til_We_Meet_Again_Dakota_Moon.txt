We talked for hours, trying to figure it out
Running out of things to say
Wish I could tell you, I was going to stay
You know it's getting late

Now's the time, please don't cry
But we've got to let it go
Deep inside we both know why
We've been through this before

I don't want to have to say goodbye tonight
So til we meet again
Maybe another place, another time

I don't know when
But I'll think of you till then
Til we meet again, again

I know we promised, we'd never be here
That we'd never come to this
We tried so hard, as hard as we could
But somehow we just missed

So now's the time, baby, please don't cry
But we've got to let it go
Oh, deep inside, we both know why
We've been through this before

I don't want to have to say goodbye tonight
So til we meet again
Maybe another place, another time

I don't know when
But I'll think of you till then
Til we meet again

We've been through this before

I don't want to have to say goodbye tonight
So til we meet again
Maybe another place, another time

I don't know when
But I'll think of you till then
Til we meet again
But I'll think of you till then
Til we meet again
