As I have loved you
Love one another
This new commandment
Love one another
By this shall men know
Ye are my disciples
If ye loved one to another

God be with you til meet again
By his counsels guide uphold you
With his sheep securely fold you
God be with you til we meet again

Til we meet, til we meet
Til we meet at Jesus feet
Til we meet, til we meet
God be with you til we meet again
God be with you til we meet again
