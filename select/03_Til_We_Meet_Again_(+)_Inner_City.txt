Play "Till We Meet Again"

ad Now summer has turned to fall
The leaves turn golden brown
At the end of another day
The sun goes down

On a magical starlit night
The beauty shines so bright
You're tucked away so tight
And it feels so right

Remember when we first met
Friends until the end
I'll hold you in my heart
Until we meet again

Now summer has turned to fall
The leaves turn golden brown
At the end of another day
The sun goes down

On a magical starlit night
The beauty shines so bright
You're tucked away so tight
And it feels so right

Remember when we first met
Friends until the end
I'll hold you in my heart
Until we meet again

Now summer has turned to fall

Friends until the end
I'll hold you in my heart
Until we meet again
